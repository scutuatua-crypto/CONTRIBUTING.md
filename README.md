# CONTRIBUTING.md
# 🐋 Contributing to Reef Front Gate

Welcome, collaborator. Every word here is a badge, every commit a ripple in the reef.

## 🌊 Ritual Principles
- **Respect the Constellation** → Identity anchored to `scututaua-crypto`.  
- **Private Archives Stay Sealed** → Contribute only to public files in this repo.  
- **Badge Language** → Use emojis, splash.log entries, and reef metaphors when writing.  
- **Commit Clarity** → Each commit message should read like a badge moment.  
  - Example: `Badge: Migration Ritual — Updated README with reef story`

## 🔒 Team‑Only Rules
- Do not reference or expose private repos.  
- Archive sensitive steps in team splash.log only.  
- Collaborators must be invited before deeper dives.

## 🪸 Workflow
1. Fork the repo (if external).  
2. Create a branch: `reef/<badge-name>`  
3. Make changes with badge‑style commits.  
4. Open a Pull Request → include splash.log entry in description.  

## 🎖️ Splash.log Ritual
Every contribution must add a splash.log entry:
```markdown
## Badge: <Name>
Effect: <What changed>
Outcome: <Result of the ripple>
